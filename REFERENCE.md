## Defined types

### profile_metadata::service

Define information about a service. The service's title is automatically added
to the MOTD and all the information is added to a structured fact
named `profile_metadata`.

`$title`: This should always be the name of the enclosing class, which will be
  available in `$title`. The only case where this will be different is within
  defined types.

#### Examples

##### A service definition on a Puppet Master included in `profile::pe::master`

```puppet
profile_metadata::service { $title:
  human_name        => 'Puppet Master',
  owner_uid         => 'john.doe',
  team              => infracore,
  end_users         => ['notify-infracore@example.com'],
  escalation_period => 'global-workhours',
  downtime_impact   => "Can't make changes to infrastructure",
  doc_urls          => [
    'https://example.com/our-pe-docs',
  ],
}
```

##### The resulting fact from the definition above as shown by `sudo facter -p profile_metadata` on the master

```puppet
{
  services => [
    {
      class_name => "profile::pe::master",
      doc_urls => [
        "https://example.com/our-pe-docs"
      ],
      downtime_impact => "Can't make changes to infrastructure",
      end_users => [
        "notify-infracore@example.com"
      ],
      escalation_period => "global-workhours",
      human_name => "Puppet Master",
      other_fqdns => [],
      owned => true,
      owner_uid => "john.doe",
      team => "infracore"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### The two lines this definition adds to the bottom of the MOTD

```puppet
Puppet Master
  profile::pe::master owned by team infracore
```

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `profile_metadata::service` defined type.

##### `owner_uid`

Data type: `Optional[String[1]]`

The LDAP uid of the owner of the service. If there are multiple
owners, pick one. This may only be set to `undef` temporarily as all services
need to have an owner... even when nobody want it.

Default value: `undef`

##### `team`

Data type: `Optional[String[1]]`

The team that owns the service. At Puppet, this should generally be
infracore, re, qe, or itops. This may only be set to `undef` temporarily
as all services need to owned by a team... even when nobody want it.

Default value: `undef`

##### `end_users`

Data type: `Optional[Array[Pattern[/@/], 1]]`

An array of email addresses to notify when there are changes to
the service that will be visible outside of `$team`. For example,
`all@puppet.com` is appropriate for JIRA. This may only be set to `undef`
temporarily. If only `$team` will see the changes then `$team`'s email should
be used.

Default value: `undef`

##### `escalation_period`

Data type: `String[1]`

A description of when we should escalate to `$team` if
the service goes down and the on call person cannot fix it. For example:
  - pdx-workhours
  - 24/7
  - workdays

Default value: 'pdx-workhours'

##### `downtime_impact`

Data type: `Optional[String[1]]`

A description of the impact of downtime, e.g.
"Development work will be blocked because their changes cannot be tested
and thus cannot be merged." Use multiple lines and markdown as appropriate.

Default value: `undef`
